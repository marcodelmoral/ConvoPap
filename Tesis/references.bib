abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

abstract = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has become one of the major research subjects in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology. In this article, the motivation and philosophy for early development of CAD schemes are presented together with the current status and future potential of CAD in a PACS environment. With CAD, radiologists use the computer output as a "second opinion" and make the final decisions. CAD is a concept established by taking into account equally the roles of physicians and computers, whereas automated computer diagnosis is a concept based on computer algorithms only. With CAD, the performance by computers does not have to be comparable to or better than that by physicians, but needs to be complementary to that by physicians. In fact, a large number of CAD systems have been employed for assisting physicians in the early detection of breast cancers on mammograms. A CAD scheme that makes use of lateral chest images has the potential to improve the overall performance in the detection of lung nodules when combined with another CAD scheme for PA chest images. Because vertebral fractures can be detected reliably by computer on lateral chest radiographs, radiologists' accuracy in the detection of vertebral fractures would be improved by the use of CAD, and thus early diagnosis of osteoporosis would become possible. In MRA, a CAD system has been developed for assisting radiologists in the detection of intracranial aneurysms. On successive bone scan images, a CAD scheme for detection of interval changes has been developed by use of temporal subtraction images. In the future, many CAD schemes could be assembled as packages and implemented as a part of PACS. For example, the package for chest CAD may include the computerized detection of lung nodules, interstitial opacities, cardiomegaly, vertebral fractures, and interval changes in chest radiographs as well as the computerized classification of benign and malignant nodules and the differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases. In order to assist in the differential diagnosis, it would be possible to search for and retrieve images (or lesions) with known pathology, which would be very similar to a new unknown case, from PACS when a reliable and useful method has been developed for quantifying the similarity of a pair of images for visual comparison by radiologists.},

It is found that for some values of k, and for m not too large, intervals obtained in this way are shorter than those using the F distribution or the Studentized range.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Medical Image segmentation is an important image processing step. Comparing images to evaluate the quality of segmentation is an essential part of measuring progress in this research area. Some of the challenges in evaluating medical segmentation are: metric selection, the use in the literature of multiple definitions for certain metrics, inefficiency of the metric calculation implementations leading to difficulties with large volumes, and lack of support for fuzzy segmentation by existing metrics. RESULT First we present an overview of 20 evaluation metrics selected based on a comprehensive literature review. For fuzzy segmentation, which shows the level of membership of each voxel to multiple classes, fuzzy definitions of all metrics are provided. We present a discussion about metric properties to provide a guide for selecting evaluation metrics. Finally, we propose an efficient evaluation tool implementing the 20 selected metrics. The tool is optimized to perform efficiently in terms of speed and required memory, also if the image size is extremely large as in the case of whole body MRI or CT volume segmentation. An implementation of this tool is available as an open source project. CONCLUSION We propose an efficient evaluation tool for 3D medical image segmentation using 20 evaluation metrics and provide guidelines for selecting a subset of these metrics that is suitable for the data and the segmentation task.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.

abstract = {The most cost effective method of prevention and detection of cervical cancer is the Pap smear. In abnormal Pap smear, colposcopy, endocervical curettage and biopsy will be done. Gold standard method in detecting cervical lesion is biopsy. Now in two ways conventional Pap smear and liquid base are routine diagnostic technique in Iran and given easily and cost-effectiveness of this method in the detection of cervical lesions to determine the sensitivity the objective of this study was compare three methods of Pap smear and colposcopy in detection of any lesion to gold standard biopsy in the positive ASC cases who referred to gynecologic Oncology Clinic of shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Science. This study is a descriptive analytic in 2009-2010 years on 150 cases of patients with Atypical Squamose Cell (ASC) results in previous pap smear ,conventional pap smear, liquid based pap smear, colposcopy and cervical biopsy had been done for all patient and finally data were analyzed with chi-square statistical test on spss ver 16 saftware. Average age of patients in this study was, 42 ± 9.9 year and reason for referring patients in 35.4{\%} of cases was due to follow-up of abnormal results of previous Pap smear, in 30{\%} bleeding, 12{\%} Pain and 2.6{\%} percent of cases was checking-up. In final results of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy any of the methods conventional and liquid based Pap smear and colposcopy were compared with cervical biopsy as a gold standard. The conventional Pap smear method had a sensitivity 51{\%}, specificity 66.6{\%}, PPV 96{\%}, NPV was 8{\%} and accuracy was 92{\%}, about the liquid base Pap smear method, sensitivity was 55.3{\%}, specificity was 77.7{\%}, PPV was 97.5{\%}, NPV was 10{\%} and accuracy was 56/6{\%}. About the colposcopy, sensitivity was70/9 {\%} specificity 44/4{\%}, PPV was 95.2{\%}, NPV was 8/8{\%} and accuracy was 69.3{\%}. The relationship between sensitivity results of conventional Pap smear and colposcopy, with p{\textless}0.001 and between the results of sensitivity of liquid based cytology and colposcopy with p{\textless}0.01 relationship was significant. Colposcopy has the best efficacy in detecting any cervical lesion in compared with any other diagnostic technique. so that further studies with more detailed plans and bigger sample sizes are suggested for obtaining reliable result.},

abstract = {Pattern-recognizing immune proteins help determine whether a women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) will develop cervical cancer. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer, but not all HPV infections lead to cervical cancer. Chunsheng Li from the University of Pennsylvania, USA, and colleagues discuss how the immune system normally clears HPV from the body but that the virus can sometimes take root and cause persistent infection by interfering with the function of viral-recognizing Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a class of proteins that act as the immune system's earliest points of pathogen detection. Changes in the TLR-related signaling then affect the immune microenvironment in the cervix in ways that allow lesions and eventually cancer to form. Therapeutic strategies that enhance TLR function are a promising avenue for future treatment of HPV-associated diseases.},

@misc{Vapnik1999,
abstract = {Four years have passed since the first edition of this book. These years were "fast time" in the development of new approaches in statistical inference inspired by learning theory. During this time, new function estimation methods have been created where a high dimensionality of the unknown function does not always require a large number of observations in order to obtain a good estimate. The new methods control generalization using capacity factors that do not necessarily depend on dimensionality of the space. These factors were known in the VC theory for many years. However, the practical significance of capacity control has become clear only recently after the appearance of support vector machines (SVM). In contrast to classical methods of statistics where in order to control performance one decreases the dimensionality of a feature space, the SVM dramatically increases dimensionality and relies on the so-called large margin factor. In the first edition of this book general learning theory including SVM methods was introduced. At that time SVM methods of learning were brand new, some of them were introduced for a first time. Now SVM margin control methods represents one of the most important directions both in theory and application of learning. In the second edition of the book three new chapters devoted to the SVM methods were added. They include generalization of SVM method for estimating real-valued functions, direct methods of learning based on solving (using SVM) multidimensional integral equations, and extension of the empirical risk minimization principle and its application to SVM. The years since the first edition of the book have also changed the general philosophy in our understanding the of nature of the induction problem. After many successful experiments with SVM, researchers became more determined in criticism of the classical philosophy of generalization based on the principle of Occam's razor. This intellectual determination also is a very important part of scientific achievement. Note that the creation of the new methods of inference could have happened in the early 1970: All the necessary elements of the theory and the SVM algorithm were known. It took twenty-five years to reach this inteIIectual determination. Now the analysis of generalization from the pure theoretical issues become a very practical subject, and this fact adds important details to a general picture of the developing computer learning problem described in the first edition of the book.},

abstract = {A quantum dynamic model of decision-making is presented, and it is compared with a previously established Markov model. Both the quantum and the Markov models are formulated as random walk decision processes, but the probabilistic principles differ between the two approaches. Quantum dynamics describe the evolution of complex valued probability amplitudes over time, whereas Markov models describe the evolution of real valued probabilities over time. Quantum dynamics generate interference effects, which are not possible with Markov models. An interference effect occurs when the probability of the union of two possible paths is smaller than each individual path alone. The choice probabilities and distribution of choice response time for the quantum model are derived, and the predictions are contrasted with the Markov model.},

abstract = {The history of histology indicates that there have been significant changes in the techniques used for histological staining through chemical, molecular biology assays and immunological techniques, collectively referred to as histochemistry. Early histologists used the readily available chemicals to prepare tissues for microscopic studies; these laboratory chemicals were potassium dichromate, alcohol and the mercuric chloride to harden cellular tissues. Staining techniques used were carmine, silver nitrate, Giemsa, Trichrome Stains, Gram Stain and Hematoxylin among others. The purpose of this research was to assess past and current literature reviews, as well as case studies, with the aim of informing ways in which histological stains have been improved in the modern age. Results from the literature review has indicated that there has been an improvement in histopathology and histotechnology in stains used. There has been a rising need for efficient, accurate and less complex staining procedures. Many stain procedures are still in use today, and many others have been replaced with new immunostaining, molecular, non-culture and other advanced staining techniques. Some staining methods have been abandoned because the chemicals required have been medically proven to be toxic. The case studies indicated that in modern histology a combination of different stain techniques are used to enhance the effectiveness of the staining process. Currently, improved histological stains, have been modified and combined with other stains to improve their effectiveness.},

STUDY DESIGN The present review is based on a review of recent literature and an evaluation of the authors' personal experiences. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION In recent years the practice of cytopathology, nationwide and in our institute, has witnessed a major change affecting gynecologic and nongynecologic cytology. There has been a decline in the number of Papanicolaou tests which has affected the utilization of cytotechnologists and provoked a reorganization of their work flow. The "need to do more with less" in the era of targeted therapy/personalized medicine has resulted in an increasing preference for needle core biopsy when performing a rapid on-site evaluation. We feel that this change is unavoidable. It is pertinent that cytopathologists as a group recognize this change and prepare themselves and the trainees not only to become adapt but also to use this as an opportunity to discover the yet unexplored world of cytology.},

abstract = {Feature engineering is a crucial step in the machine-learning pipeline, yet this topic is rarely examined on its own. With this practical book, you'll learn techniques for extracting and transforming features—the numeric representations of raw data—into formats for machine-learning models. Each chapter guides you through a single data problem, such as how to represent text or image data. Together, these examples illustrate the main principles of feature engineering.

Rather than simply teach these principles, authors Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari focus on practical application with exercises throughout the book. The closing chapter brings everything together by tackling a real-world, structured dataset with several feature-engineering techniques. Python packages including numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib are used in code examples.

You'll examine:

    - Feature engineering for numeric data: filtering, binning, scaling, log transforms, and power transforms
    - Natural text techniques: bag-of-words, n-grams, and phrase detection
    - Frequency-based filtering and feature scaling for eliminating uninformative features
    - Encoding techniques of categorical variables, including feature hashing and bin-counting
    - Model-based feature engineering with principal component analysis
    - The concept of model stacking, using k-means as a featurization technique
    - Image feature extraction with manual and deep-learning techniques},

@article{Gao2017,
abstract = {Accurately predicting and detecting interstitial lung disease (ILD) patterns given any computed tomography (CT) slice without any pre-processing prerequisites, such as manually delineated regions of interest (ROIs), is a clinically desirable, yet challenging goal. The majority of existing work relies on manually-provided ILD ROIs to extract sampled 2D image patches from CT slices and, from there, performs patch-based ILD categorization. Acquiring manual ROIs is labor intensive and serves as a bottleneck towards fully-automated CT imaging ILD screening over large-scale populations. Furthermore, despite the considerable high frequency of more than one ILD pattern on a single CT slice, previous works are only designed to detect one ILD pattern per slice or patch. To tackle these two critical challenges, we present multi-label deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting ILDs from holistic CT slices (instead of ROIs or sub-images). Conventional single-labeled CNN models can be augmented to cope with the possible presence of multiple ILD pattern labels, via 1) continuous-valued deep regression based robust norm loss functions or 2) a categorical objective as the sum of element-wise binary logistic losses. Our methods are evaluated and validated using a publicly available database of 658 patient CT scans under five-fold cross-validation, achieving promising performance on detecting four major ILD patterns: Ground Glass, Reticular, Honeycomb, and Emphysema. We also investigate the effectiveness of a CNN activation-based deep-feature encoding scheme using Fisher vector encoding, which treats ILD detection as spatially-unordered deep texture classification.},

The key contribution of this research focuses on atypical cases, specifically on atypical glandular cells (AGC). The expert system consists of 3 phases: (1) risk diagnosis which consists of the interpretation of a patient's clinical background and the risks for contracting CN according to specialists; (2) cytology images detection which consists of image interpretation (IM) and the Bethesda system for cytology interpretation, and (3) determination of cancer precursor injuries which consists of in retrieving the information from the prior phases and integrating the expert system by means of a fuzzy logics (FL) model. During the validation stage of the system, 21 already diagnosed cases were tested with a positive correlation in which 100{\%} effectiveness was obtained. The main contribution of this work relies on the reduction of false positives and false negatives by providing a more accurate diagnosis for CN.},

abstract = {In this presents the analyses of the Pap smear cervical cell images for cervical screening and detection. Initially preprocessed the cell images to remove unwanted noises, Followed by extraction of the cell from the background to obtain the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell which is the region of interest. It is the only parts of the cell which can be used to differentiate normal cell from abnormal one.20 salient features were extracted for training of support vector machine. SVM-RFE is used for features selection; the RFE algorithm removes unimportant features based on backward sequential selection by iteratively deleting one feature at a time, resulting in suboptimal combination of r(r{\textless}n) features with best predictive performance. Normalisation of the data was done to the feature so as to obtain a uniform distinct range – the feature values were normalised to 0 and 1. We conducted an experiment for evaluation of classifier; we adopted 10 cross validation and left one out for the testing of the classifier. Radial basis function and polynomial kernel function were used. In the first phase, we varied the value of gamma for training and evaluation, and the best classification accuracy was obtained at 9; where accuracy was 95.33{\%} and sensitivity was 93.21{\%} the performance of the classifier was increased as the value of gamma increased. In the second phase, we used polynomial kernel function, showing better performance of 97.02{\%} accuracy and 95.50{\%} of the sensitivity of the classifier. The classifier gives promising results with average accuracy of 92.961{\%}, sensitivity 90.833{\%} and specificity 80.39{\%}.},

The data con- sists of 917 images of pap-smear cells, classified carefully by cyto-technicians and doctors. The classes are difficult to separate, since classmembership is not clearly defined. Abasic data analysis provides numericalmeasures indicating how well the classes are separated, based on theMahalanobis distance norm. The paper compares the results of three advanced classifiers against a simple minimum distance classifier. The results show that while the simple classifier provides an error rate just over 6{\%}, error rates down to 1-2{\%} can be achieved with a combination of feature selection together with an advanced classsifier such as ant colony optimization. Students and researchers can access the database via the Internet, and use it to test and compare their own classification methods.},

abstract = {Label-free cell analysis is essential to personalized genomics, cancer diagnostics, and drug development as it avoids adverse effects of staining reagents on cellular viability and cell signaling. However, currently available label-free cell assays mostly rely only on a single feature and lack sufficient differentiation. Also, the sample size analyzed by these assays is limited due to their low throughput. Here, we integrate feature extraction and deep learning with high-throughput quantitative imaging enabled by photonic time stretch, achieving record high accuracy in label-free cell classification. Our system captures quantitative optical phase and intensity images and extracts multiple biophysical features of individual cells. These biophysical measurements form a hyperdimensional feature space in which supervised learning is performed for cell classification. We compare various learning algorithms including artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, and a novel deep learning pipeline, which adopts global optimization of receiver operating characteristics. As a validation of the enhanced sensitivity and specificity of our system, we show classification of white blood T-cells against colon cancer cells, as well as lipid accumulating algal strains for biofuel production. This system opens up a new path to data-driven phenotypic diagnosis and better understanding of the heterogeneous gene expressions in cells.},

abstract = {In this paper, a multiscale convolutional network (MSCN) and graph-partitioning-based method is proposed for accurate segmentation of cervical cytoplasm and nuclei. Specifically, deep learning via the MSCN is explored to extract scale invariant features, and then, segment regions centered at each pixel. The coarse segmentation is refined by an automated graph partitioning method based on the pretrained feature. The texture, shape, and contextual information of the target objects are learned to localize the appearance of distinctive boundary, which is also explored to generate markers to split the touching nuclei. For further refinement of the segmentation, a coarse-to-fine nucleus segmentation framework is developed. The computational complexity of the segmentation is reduced by using superpixel instead of raw pixels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed cervical nucleus cell segmentation delivers promising results and outperforms existing methods.},

@article{Rasky2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent decades, the incidence of cervical cancer and cervical cancer mortality in Austria has declined by varying degrees. The Pap smear is to be considered a causal factor for this decline. METHODS: This longitudinal analysis is based on a data set of Pap smear assessments collected by the Committee for Quality Assurance of the Austrian Society of Cytology. Data from 15 laboratories participating in a voluntary self-monitoring program was analyzed for the time span 2004-2008. The data was analyzed in terms of smear quality and assessment quality.A rank-correlation-test for a monotonic trend analysis in the proportion of the three parameters Pap 0, "satisfactory, but limited/SBL", and Pap IIID/IV for the timespan 2004 to 2008 was carried out. RESULTS: For this study, we analyzed an average number of 730,000 smears per year over a five-year period. Specimens from all but two laboratories, i.e. {\textless} 2{\%} of all smears, met the quality criterion for Pap 0 (Bethesda 2001 equivalent: Specimen processed and examined, but unsatisfactory for evaluation of epithelial abnormality), whilst only four laboratories, i.e. {\textless} 10{\%} of all smears, reached the national requirement for smears classified as "satisfactory, but limited/SBL".When using the Pap IIID/IV ratio (LSIL: HSIL/AIS ratio) of 3:1 to 8:1 as a surrogate quality marker for the interpretation of smears, only five laboratories met this criterion during the survey period.The trend analysis indicated only that an increasing number of samples per year is correlated with an increased proportion of Pap 0 and "satisfactory, but limited/SBL" smears. CONCLUSIONS: Although participants get regular feedback about their results, no general improvements in smear taking or assessment were observed over the years, so mandatory quality management, including the possibility of sanctions, is suggested in order to reduce adverse health effects for women.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common gynecologic infection and it occurs when there is overgrowth of the yeast called Candida. VVC diagnosis is usually done by observing a Pap smear sample under a microscope and searching for the conidium and mycelium components of Candida. This manual method is time consuming, subjective and tedious. Any diagnosis tools that detect VVC, semi- or full-automatically, can be very helpful to pathologists. This article presents a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) software to improve human diagnosis of VVC from Pap smear samples. The proposed software is designed based on phenotypic and morphology features of the Candida in Pap smear sample images. This software provide a user-friendly interface which consists of a set of image processing tools and analytical results that helps to detect Candida and determine severity of illness. The software was evaluated on 200 Pap smear sample images and obtained specificity of 91.04{\%} and sensitivity of 92.48{\%} to detect VVC. As a result, the use of the proposed software reduces diagnostic time and can be employed as a second objective opinion for pathologists.},

abstract = {"Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Given an arbitrary (large, uncountable) set C of predictors, we would like to construct a single predictor that performs asymptotically as well as the best predictor in C, on any data. Here we show that there are sets C for which such predictors exist, but none of them is a Bayesian predictor with a prior concentrated on C. In other words, there is a predictor with sublinear regret, but every Bayesian predictor must have a linear regret. This negative finding is in sharp contrast with previous results that establish the opposite for the case when one of the predictors in {\$}C{\$} achieves asymptotically vanishing error. In such a case, if there is a predictor that achieves asymptotically vanishing error for any measure in C, then there is a Bayesian predictor that also has this property, and whose prior is concentrated on (a countable subset of) C.},

abstract = {A new trend that has emerged in the field of applied artificial intelligence in the past few years is the incorporation of emotion emulation mechanisms in situated agent systems. Several researchers in the field of psychology and neural science agree that emotion is an essential aspect of human intelligence, diverging from the traditional treatment of emotion as something that inhibits rational thinking. This argument has also influenced the area of artificial intelligence and especially the young, yet vibrant field of Intelligent Virtual Agents, where it has become accepted that emotion is a key issue to achieve believable agent behaviour, The increased interest for emotions has resulted in several computational emotional models having been presented, with diverse approaches, genetically classified into cognitive and non-cognitive, inspired by areas such as neural science. Hybrid approaches have also appeared, combining both cognitive and non-cognitive elements in an attempt to accurately describe the inner workings of emotional mechanisms. Such a hybrid model is the one we adopt in this paper, aiming to apply it to SimHuman, an intelligent virtual agent platform, in order to introduce emotion awareness and affective behaviour to the agent architecture.},

abstract = {Many state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms use large scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as basic building blocks. These CNNs are known for their huge number of parameters, high redundancy in weights, and tremendous computing resource consumptions. This paper presents a learning algorithm to simplify and speed up these CNNs. Specifically, we introduce a "try-and-learn" algorithm to train pruning agents that remove unnecessary CNN filters in a data-driven way. With the help of a novel reward function, our agents removes a significant number of filters in CNNs while maintaining performance at a desired level. Moreover, this method provides an easy control of the tradeoff between network performance and its scale. Per- formance of our algorithm is validated with comprehensive pruning experiments on several popular CNNs for visual recognition and semantic segmentation tasks.},

@article{Xue2017,
abstract = {The ability to automatically detect certain types of cells or cellular subunits in microscopy images is of significant interest to a wide range of biomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods have evolved from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques. The essential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are trained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In this paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output pixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely labeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. We employ random projections to encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN regresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Furthermore, it is possible to stably recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from the predicted compressed vector using {\$}L{\_}1{\$}-norm optimization. In the past, output space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in conjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space encoding. We made substantial experiments on several benchmark datasets, where the proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as CNNCS) achieved the highest or at least top-3 performance in terms of F1-score, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2{\%} top-1 and 5.6{\%} top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5{\%} top-5 error on the validation set (3.6{\%} error on the test set) and 17.3{\%} top-1 error on the validation set.},

abstract = {Background: The standard for reading cervical cytology is for a cytoscreener to manually search across an entire slide for abnormal cells using a conventional microscope. Automated technology can select fields of view to assess abnormal cells, which allows targeted reading by cytoscreeners. In the Manual Assessment Versus Automated Reading In Cytology (MAVARIC) trial, we compared the accuracy of these techniques for the detection of underlying disease. Methods: For this randomised controlled trial, women aged 25-64 years undergoing primary cervical screening in Manchester, UK, were randomly assigned (1:2) to receive either manual reading only or paired reading (automation-assisted reading and manual reading), between March 1, 2006, and Feb 28, 2009. In the paired arm, two automated systems were used-the ThinPrep Imaging System and the FocalPoint GS Imaging System. General practices and community clinics were randomised to either ThinPrep or to SurePath (for the FocalPoint system) liquid-based cytology with block randomisation stratified by deprivation index. Samples were then individually randomised to manual reading only or paired reading only. Laboratory staff were unaware of the allocation of each slide and concealment was maintained until the end of the reporting process. The primary outcome was sensitivity of automation-assisted reading relative to manual reading for the detection of underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) in the paired arm. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN66377374. Findings: 73 266 liquid-based cytology samples were obtained from women undergoing primary cervical screening; 24 688 allocated to the manual-only arm and 48 578 to the paired-reading arm. Automation-assisted reading was 8{\%} less sensitive than manual reading (relative sensitivity 0{\textperiodcentered}92, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}89-0{\textperiodcentered}95), which was equivalent to an absolute reduction in sensitivity of 6{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}, assuming the sensitivity of manual reading to be 79{\%}. Specificity of automation-assisted reading relative to manual reading increased by 0{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (1{\textperiodcentered}006, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}005-1{\textperiodcentered}007). Interpretation: The inferior sensitivity of automation-assisted reading for the detection of CIN2+, combined with an inconsequential increase in specificity, suggests that automation-assisted reading cannot be recommended for primary cervical screening.

abstract = {Automation-assisted reading (AAR) techniques have the potential to reduce errors and increase productivity in cervical cancer screening. The sensitivity of AAR relies heavily on automated segmentation of abnormal cervical cells, which is handled poorly by current segmentation algorithms. In this paper, a global and local scheme based on graph cut approach is proposed to segment cervical cells in images with a mix of healthy and abnormal cells. For cytoplasm segmentation, the multi-way graph cut is performed globally on the a* channel enhanced image, which can be effective when the image histogram presents a non-bimodal distribution. For segmentation of nuclei, especially when they are abnormal, we propose to use graph cut adaptively and locally, which allows the combination of intensity, texture, boundary and region information. Two concave points-based approaches are integrated to split the touching-nuclei. As part of an ongoing clinical trial, preliminary validation results obtained from 21 cervical cell images with non-ideal imaging condition and pathology show that our segmentation method achieved 93{\%} accuracy for cytoplasm, and 88.4{\%} F-measure for abnormal nuclei, outperforming state of the art methods in terms of accuracy. Our method has the potential to improve the sensitivity of AAR in screening for cervical cancer. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional methods like principal component analysis and classical metric multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists (in psychometry) and economists.},

abstract = {Background and motivation: INCA (Intelligent Control Assistant for Diabetes) is a project funded by the EU with the objective to improve diabetes therapy by creating a personal control loop interacting with telemedical remote control. Development of telemedical systems generally is a complex task especially in international projects where engineering and user groups with different social and cultural background have to be included into the system development process. Objectives: To explore if and how sophisticated information system modelling and simulation techniques can improve the development of telemedical systems. Methods: For system analysis and design the MOSAIK-M approach was chosen. MOSAIK-M means "Modelling, simulation, and animation of information and communication systems in medicine". It includes a generic process scheme, a meta model and a tool environment. The generic process scheme guides modelling projects to produce models of high quality in terms of correctness, completeness and validity. The meta model defines the modelling language. In INCA MOSAIK-M is used for analysis of the problem domain, specification of the telemedical system and cost/benefit-analysis. Results: The MOSAIK-M approach was used to create two models: an "As Is"-model of the problem domain and a "To Be"-model of the INCA system. The "As Is"-model of conventional insulin pump based diabetes care comprises submodels of diabetes management, ambulatory and clinical care. The "To Be"-model describes a patient's diabetes management using a smart phone that controls an insulin pump based on continuously measured interstitial glucose. It also describes telemedical care of a patient by diabetologists and a call centre. Both models can be simulated enhanced by visualisation capabilities to explore specific cases or scenarios. This feature proved valuable for the evaluation of both models through domain experts. The "To Be" model is used to guide the implementation of the system. Both models are being augmented by cost structures to support cost/benefit-analysis. Conclusions: Even a complex telemedical system like the INCA system can be successfully specified using sophisticated modelling and simulation bused approaches like MOSAIK-M. The resulting specification is a result of its own and ensures a lusting effect of the definitions and specifications produced during the project. International cooperation and evaluation of the system design prior to its implementation profit from simulation and visualisation capabilities of MOSAIK-M.},

@book{Bishop2013,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the role of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in cytopathology. More specifically, it aims to highlight the importance of employing ANNs in existing and future applications and in identifying unexplored or poorly explored research topics. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic search was conducted in scientific databases for articles related to cytopathology and ANNs with respect to anatomical places of the human body where cytopathology is performed. For each anatomic system/organ, the major outcomes described in the scientific literature are presented and the most important aspects are highlighted. RESULTS: The vast majority of ANN applications are related to cervical cytopathology, specifically for the ANN-based, semiautomated commercial diagnostic system PAPNET. For cervical cytopathology, there is a plethora of studies relevant to the diagnostic accuracy; in addition, there are also efforts evaluating cost-effectiveness and applications on primary, secondary, or hybrid screening. For the rest of the anatomical sites, such as the gastrointestinal system, thyroid gland, urinary tract, and breast, there are significantly less efforts relevant to the application of ANNs. Additionally, there are still anatomi- cal systems for which ANNs have never been applied on their cytological material. CONCLUSIONS: Cytopathology is an ideal discipline to apply ANNs. In general, diagnosis is performed by experts via the light microscope. However, this approach introduces subjectivity, because this is not a universal and objective measurement process. This has resulted in the existence of a gray zone between normal and pathological cases. From the analysis of related articles, it is obvious that there is a need to perform more thorough analyses, using extensive number of cases and particularly for the nonexplored organs. Efforts to apply such systems within the laboratory test environment are required for},

abstract = {Diabetic nephropathy is a life-threatening complication if not controlled properly. Early detection and effective control prevent its progression. In this study, the development of a Fuzzy Expert System (FES) is proposed to help doctors assess the nephropathy control in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The study is based on a FES that was developed with the use of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG), data bases and the expertise of a team of doctors. It considers the use of input variables such as Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), serum creatinine, blood glucose, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Age (T2DMA), uric acid, hypertension and dyslipidemia. All these factors, give an efficient nephropathy control assessment. Sixty tests were performed using the expertise of a team of doctors, the expected results were compared with those estimated by the FES (using the same cases), and it was observed that the FES succeeds in up to 93.33{\%} of the cases. The response surface analysis shows that GFR, serum creatinine and hypertension have a greater impact in the nephropathy control. This system supports the doctors in nephropathy control, but it does not estimate the renal failure stages. Nephropathy control is a clinical problem that includes uncertainty and inaccuracy, so the use of a FES is recommended to overcome this problem, since fuzzy systems help to assess the inherent uncertainty degree.},

Slides of Pap smear test of about of about 200 clinical cases were collected from multiple health care institutions in north India and images were captured using a digital microscope. Images of 8091 cervical cells were obtained from these slides, which were quantitatively profiled and calibrated to prepare a primary database that could reflect the morphological features of the cells of cervix. All the algorithms were trained using this database and were tested using a subset of unseen cells. The generalizing ability of algorithms was tested and its performance was evaluated against the human pathologist using percentage of correctly classified cells and sensitively. Results: Almost all the algorithms performed well for identifying the cells infected by cancer by classifying the cells according Bethesda system of classification. Among all the algorithms used, multiple backpropagation neural networks presented an efficiency of about 78.0{\%}, whereas the efficiency of all other algorithms was in the range of 69{\%} to 76{\%}. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the artificial intelligence based techniques can effectively be used for developing tools for mass level screening of cervical cancer.

In this paper, we show that how unsupervised feature learn-ing can be used for cancer detection and can-cer type analysis from gene expression data. The main advantage of the proposed method over previous cancer detection approaches is the possibility of applying data from various types of cancer to automatically form fea-tures which help to enhance the detection and diagnosis of a specific one. The technique is here applied to the detection and classifica-tion of cancer types based on gene expression data. In this domain we show that the per-formance of this method is better than that of previous methods, therefore promising a more comprehensive and generic approach for cancer detection and diagnosis.},

abstract = {This paper presents a unified, efficient model of random decision forests which can be applied to a number of machine learning, computer vision and medical image analysis tasks. Our model extends existing forest-based techniques as it unifies clas- sification, regression, density estimation, manifold learning, semi- supervised learning and active learning under the same decision forest framework. This means that the core implementation needs be written and optimized only once, and can then be applied to many diverse tasks. The proposed model may be used both in a generative or dis- criminative way and may be applied to discrete or continuous, labelled or unlabelled data. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) proposing a single, proba- bilistic and efficient model for a variety of learning tasks; 2) demonstrat- ing margin-maximizing properties of classification forests; 3) introduc- ing density forests for learning accurate probability density functions; 4) proposing efficient algorithms for sampling from the forest genera- tive model; 5) introducing manifold forests for non-linear embedding and dimensionality reduction; 6) proposing new and efficient forest-based algorithms for transductive and active learning. We discuss how alternatives such as random ferns and extremely randomized trees stem from our more general model. This paper is directed at both students who wish to learn the ba- sics of decision forests, as well as researchers interested in our new contributions. It presents both fundamental and novel concepts in a structured way, with many illustrative examples and real-world appli- cations. Thorough comparisons with state of the art algorithms such as support vector machines, boosting and Gaussian processes are pre- sented and relative advantages and disadvantages discussed. The many synthetic examples and existing commercial applications demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and its flexibility.},

abstract = {The artificial neural network (ANN)-a machine learning technique inspired by the human neuronal synapse system-was introduced in the 1950s. However, the ANN was previously limited in its ability to solve actual problems, due to the vanishing gradient and overfitting problems with training of deep architecture, lack of computing power, and primarily the absence of sufficient data to train the computer system. Interest in this concept has lately resurfaced, due to the availability of big data, enhanced computing power with the current graphics processing units, and novel algorithms to train the deep neural network. Recent studies on this technology suggest its potentially to perform better than humans in some visual and auditory recognition tasks, which may portend its applications in medicine and healthcare, especially in medical imaging, in the foreseeable future. This review article offers perspectives on the history, development, and applications of deep learning technology, particularly regarding its applications in medical imaging.},

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpass-ing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordi-nary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.},

The Nottingham Histologic Score system is highly correlated with the shape and appearance of breast cancer nuclei in histopathological images.

Recently there has been interest in the application of {\&}{\#}x201C;Deep Learning{\&}{\#}x201D; strategies for classification and analysis of big image data. Histopathology, given its size and complexity, represents an excellent use case for application of deep learning strategies. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a deep learning strategy, is presented for efficient nuclei detection on high-resolution histopathological images of breast cancer. The SSAE learns high-level features from just pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of nuclei. A sliding window operation is applied to each image in order to represent image patches via high-level features obtained via the auto-encoder, which are then subsequently fed to a classifier which categorizes each image patch as nuclear or non-nuclear. Across a cohort of 500 histopathological images (2200 {\&}{\#}x00D7; 2200) and approximately 3500 manually segmented individual nuclei serving as the groundtruth, SSAE was shown to have an improved F-measure 84.49{\%} and an average area under Precision-Recall curve (AveP) 78.83{\%}. The SSAE approach also out-performed nine other state of the art nuclear detection strategies.},

But HIT systems are not widely available, and even if available are not properly utilized. This paper reviewed some available HIT systems in order to have an idea on their availability. Also works on acceptance of HIT systems were reviewed so as to understand the level of research done in the area. The problems identified from this work include lack of availability of these systems especially in developing countries, insufficient works on user acceptance of HIT systems, etc. These limitations can be overcome when researchers study the factors that will affect the user acceptance of these systems, and then consider the factors while developing the systems. Finally, a conceptual model of HIT acceptance in developing countries is proposed.},

abstract = {Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

The detection of cervical cancer cells uses an ANN for classifying the normal and abnormal cells in the cervix region of the uterus. Cervical cancer detection is very challenging because this cancer occurs without any symptoms. The classification between the normal, abnormal and cancerous cells is identified by using an artificial neural network which produces accurate results than the manual screening methods like Pap smear and Liquid cytology based (LCB) test. The ANN uses several architectures for easy and accurate detection of cervical cells. In this paper, a survey and analysis on the different types of architecture in the ANN with its accuracy results and performance are discussed. A brief description about the working and detection of cervical cancer is presented which is useful for the classification of normal and abnormal cervical cells.},

@article{Malm2013,
abstract = {Since its introduction in the 1940s the Pap-smear test has helped reduce the incidence of cervical cancer dramatically in countries where regular screening is standard. The automation of this procedure is an open problem that has been ongoing for over fifty years without reaching satisfactory results. Existing systems are discouragingly expensive and yet they are only able to make a correct distinction between normal and abnormal samples in a fraction of cases. Therefore, they are limited to acting as support for the cytotechnicians as they perform their manual screening. The main reason for the current limitations is that the automated systems struggle to overcome the complexity of the cell structures. Samples are covered in artefacts such as blood cells, overlapping and folded cells, and bacteria, that hamper the segmentation processes and generate large number of suspicious objects. The classifiers designed to differentiate between normal cells and pre-cancerous cells produce unpredictable results when classifying artefacts. In this paper, we propose a sequential classification scheme focused on removing unwanted objects, debris, from an initial segmentation result, intended to be run before the actual normal/abnormal classifier. The method has been evaluated using three separate datasets obtained from cervical samples prepared using both the standard Pap-smear approach as well as the more recent liquid based cytology sample preparation technique. We show success in removing more than 99{\%} of the debris without loosing more than around one percent of the epithelial cells detected by the segmentation process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{Yosinski2014,
abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce the olog, or ontology log, a category-theoretic model for knowledge representation (KR). Grounded in formal mathematics, ologs can be rigorously formulated and cross-compared in ways that other KR models (such as semantic networks) cannot. An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research.},

The purpose of the Papanicolaou method is to diagnose pre-cancerous cell changes before they progress to invasive carcinoma. In this paper a metaheuristic algorithm is proposed in order to classify the cells. Two databases are used, constructed in different times by expert MDs, consisting of 917 and 500 images of pap smear cells, respectively. Each cell is described by 20 numerical features, and the cells fall into 7 classes but a minimal requirement is to separate normal from abnormal cells, which is a 2 class problem. For finding the best possible performing feature subset selection problem, an effective genetic algorithm scheme is proposed. This algorithmic scheme is combined with a number of nearest neighbor based classifiers. Results show that classification accuracy generally outperforms other previously applied intelligent approaches. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

@article{Hastie2009,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {In medical imaging, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is a rapidly growing dynamic area of research. In recent years, significant attempts are made for the enhancement of computer aided diagnosis applications because errors in medical diagnostic systems can result in seriously misleading medical treatments. Machine learning is important in Computer Aided Diagnosis. After using an easy equation, objects such as organs may not be indicated accurately. So, pattern recognition fundamentally involves learning from examples. In the field of bio-medical, pattern recognition and machine learning promise the improved accuracy of perception and diagnosis of disease. They also promote the objectivity of decision-making process. For the analysis of high-dimensional and multimodal bio-medical data, machine learning offers a worthy approach for making classy and automatic algorithms. This survey paper provides the comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms for diagnosis of different diseases such as heart disease, diabetes disease, liver disease, dengue disease and hepatitis disease. It brings attention towards the suite of machine learning algorithms and tools that are used for the analysis of diseases and decision-making process accordingly.},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {Automation-assisted cervical screening via Pap smear or liquid-based cytology (LBC) is a highly effective cell imaging based cancer detection tool, where cells are partitioned into "abnormal" and "normal" categories. However, the success of most traditional classification methods relies on the presence of accurate cell segmentations. Despite sixty years of research in this field, accurate segmentation remains a challenge in the presence of cell clusters and pathologies. Moreover, previous classification methods are only built upon the extraction of hand-crafted features, such as morphology and texture. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a method to directly classify cervical cells - without prior segmentation - based on deep features, using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). First, the ConvNet is pre-trained on a natural image dataset. It is subsequently fine-tuned on a cervical cell dataset consisting of adaptively re-sampled image patches coarsely centered on the nuclei. In the testing phase, aggregation is used to average the prediction scores of a similar set of image patches. The proposed method is evaluated on both Pap smear and LBC datasets. Results show that our method outperforms previous algorithms in classification accuracy (98.3{\%}), area under the curve (AUC) (0.99) values, and especially specificity (98.3{\%}), when applied to the Herlev benchmark Pap smear dataset and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. Similar superior performances are also achieved on the HEMLBC (H{\&}E stained manual LBC) dataset. Our method is promising for the development of automation-assisted reading systems in primary cervical screening.},

In this paper, a new hybrid differential evolution (DE) algorithm with a newly added crossover operator is proposed to evolve the architectures of CNNs of any lengths, which is named DECNN. There are three new ideas in the proposed DECNN method. Firstly, an existing effective encoding scheme is refined to cater for variable-length CNN architectures; Secondly, the new mutation and crossover operators are developed for variable-length DE to optimise the hyperparameters of CNNs; Finally, the new second crossover is introduced to evolve the depth of the CNN architectures. The proposed algorithm is tested on six widely-used benchmark datasets and the results are compared to 12 state-of-the-art methods, which shows the proposed method is vigorously competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed method is also compared with a method using particle swarm optimisation with a similar encoding strategy named IPPSO, and the proposed DECNN outperforms IPPSO in terms of the accuracy.},

However, their application to some realworld problems has been hampered by the lack of a training algonthm which reliably finds a nearly globally optimal set of weights in a relatively short time. Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization procedures which are good at exploring a large and complex space in an intelligent way to find values close to the global optimum. Hence, they are well suited to the problem of training feedforward networks. In this paper, we describe a set of experiments performed on data from a sonar image classification problem. These experiments both 1) illustrate the improvements gained by using a genetic algorithm rather than backpropagation and 2) chronicle the evolution of the performance of the genetic algorithm as we added more and more domain-specific knowledge into it.},

abstract = {Development of a technico-economic optimization strategy of cogeneration systems of electricity/hydrogen, consists in finding an optimal efficiency of the generating cycle and heat delivery system, maximizing the energy production and minimizing the production costs. The first part of the paper is related to the development of a multiobjective optimization library (MULTIGEN) to tackle all types of problems arising from cogeneration. After a literature review for identifying the most efficient methods, the MULTIGEN library is described, and the innovative points are listed. A new stopping criterion, based on the stagnation of the Pareto front, may lead to significant decrease of computational times, particularly in the case of problems involving only integer variables. Two practical examples are presented in the last section. The former is devoted to a bicriteria optimization of both exergy destruction and total cost of the plant, for a generating cycle coupled with a Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR). The second example consists in designing the heat exchanger of the generating turbomachine. Three criteria are optimized: the exchange surface, the exergy destruction and the number of exchange modules. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Surrogate-assistance approaches have long been used in computationally expensive domains to improve the data-efficiency of optimization algorithms. Neuroevolution, however, has so far resisted the application of these techniques because it requires the surrogate model to make fitness predictions based on variable topologies, instead of a vector of parameters. Our main insight is that we can sidestep this problem by using kernel-based surrogate models, which require only the definition of a distance measure between individuals. Our second insight is that the well-established Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm provides a computationally efficient distance measure between dissimilar networks in the form of "compatibility distance", initially designed to maintain topological diversity. Combining these two ideas, we introduce a surrogate-assisted neuroevolution algorithm that combines NEAT and a surrogate model built using a compatibility distance kernel. We demonstrate the data-efficiency of this new algorithm on the low dimensional cart-pole swing-up problem, as well as the higher dimensional half-cheetah running task. In both tasks the surrogate-assisted variant achieves the same or better results with several times fewer function evaluations as the original NEAT.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new cellular genetic algorithm for solving multiobjective continuous optimization problems. Our approach is characterized by using an external archive to store nondominated solutions and a feedback mechanism in which solutions from this archive randomly replace existing individuals in the population after each iteration. The result is a simple and elitist algorithm called MOCell. Our proposal has been evaluated with both constrained and unconstrained problems and compared against NSGA-II and SPEA2, two state-of-the-art evolutionary multiobjective optimizers. For the studied benchmark, our experiments indicate that MOCell obtains competitive results in terms of convergence and hypervolume, and it clearly outperforms the other two compared algorithms concerning the diversity of the solutions along the Pareto front. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26{\%} relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66{\%}). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level performance (5.1{\%}, Russakovsky et al.) on this visual recognition challenge.},

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use$\backslash$nnon-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1)$\backslash$ntheir O(MN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) computational complexity (where M is the number$\backslash$nof objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism$\backslash$napproach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE$\backslash$nThis paper presents an innovative idea of applying a hybrid ensemble technique i.e. ensemble of ensemble methods for improving the predictive performance of Artificial intelligence based system for screening of cervical cancer by characterization and classification of Pap smear images. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY$\backslash$nPapanicolaou smear (also referred to as Pap smear) is a microscopic examination of samples of human cells scraped from the lower, narrow part of the uterus, called the cervix. A sample of cells after being stained by using Papanicolaou method is analyzed under microscope for the presence of any unusual developments indicating any precancerous and potentially precancerous changes. Abnormal findings, if observed are subjected to further precise diagnostic subroutines. Examining the cell images for abnormalities in the cervix provides grounds for provision of prompt action and thus reducing incidence and deaths from cervical cancer. It is the most popular technique used for screening of cervical cancer. Pap smear test, if done with a regular screening programs and proper follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer mortality by up to 80{\%} [1]. The contribution of this paper is that we have pioneered to apply hybrid ensemble technique to screen cervical cancer by classification of Pap smear data. The hybrid ensemble designed in this work has also presented an idea to use an ensemble of ensemble techniques. Using such a technique, the classification potentials of individual algorithms are fused together to gain greater classification accuracy. In addition to this we have also presented a comparative analysis of various artificial intelligence based algorithms for screening of cervical cancer. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nThe results indicate that hybrid ensemble technique is an efficient method for classification of Pap smear images and hence can be effectively used for diagnosis of cervical cancer. Among all the algorithms implemented, the hybrid ensemble approach outperformed {\&} expressed an efficiency of about 96{\%} for 2-class problem and about 78{\%} for 7-class problem. The results when compared with the all the standalone classifiers were significantly better for both 2-class and 7-class problems.},

abstract = {Current automation-assisted technologies for screening cervical cancer mainly rely on automated liquid-based cytology slides with proprietary stain. This is not a cost-efficient approach to be utilized in developing countries. In this article, we propose the first automation-assisted system to screen cervical cancer in manual liquid-based cytology (MLBC) slides with hematoxylin and eosin (H{\&}E) stain, which is inexpensive and more applicable in developing countries. This system consists of three main modules: image acquisition, cell segmentation, and cell classification. First, an autofocusing scheme is proposed to find the global maximum of the focus curve by iteratively comparing image qualities of specific locations. On the autofocused images, the multiway graph cut (GC) is performed globally on the a* channel enhanced image to obtain cytoplasm segmentation. The nuclei, especially abnormal nuclei, are robustly segmented by using GC adaptively and locally. Two concave-based approaches are integrated to split the touching nuclei. To classify the segmented cells, features are selected and preprocessed to improve the sensitivity, and contextual and cytoplasm information are introduced to improve the specificity. Experiments on 26 consecutive image stacks demonstrated that the dynamic autofocusing accuracy was 2.06 $\mu$m. On 21 cervical cell images with nonideal imaging condition and pathology, our segmentation method achieved a 93{\%} accuracy for cytoplasm, and a 87.3{\%} F-measure for nuclei, both outperformed state of the art works in terms of accuracy. Additional clinical trials showed that both the sensitivity (88.1{\%}) and the specificity (100{\%}) of our system are satisfyingly high. These results proved the feasibility of automation-assisted cervical cancer screening in MLBC slides with H{\&}E stain, which is highly desirable in community health centers and small hospitals.},

Since the background and cytoplasm contrast is not relatively obvious, cytoplasm segmentation is first performed. Deep learning based on CNN is explored for region of interest detection. A coarse-to-fine nucleus segmentation for cervical cancer cell segmentation and further refinement is also developed. Experimental results show that an accuracy of 94.50{\%} is achieved for nucleus region detection and a precision of 0.9143±0.0202 and a recall of 0.8726±0.0008 are achieved for nucleus cell segmentation.
